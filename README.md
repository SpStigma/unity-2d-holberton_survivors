## üìù <span id="description">Description</span>

### Project Overview:

Holberton Survivors is an action game inspired by the popular title Vampire Survivors. Developed by Yoann Rivet and me, we undertook this project as our end-of-first-year assignment at Holberton School. With no prior experience in Unity and C#, we started from scratch, dedicating one month to preparation and another to intensive coding, learning and implementing these technologies along the way.

### Objective and scope:

The primary goal of Holberton Survivors game is to serve as a learning platform for the essential principles of video game development, focusing on the C# programming language and Unity. We presented this project to a jury to obtain our diploma, validating our first year of learning in programming fundamentals at Holberton Schools. This experience has been invaluable for honing our skills in coding, and project management

### Non-Profit and learning emphasis:

It's important to highlight that Holberton Survivors is a non-profit initiative, primarily undertaken as an educational endeavor. We are still in the early stages of our learning journey, gearing up for a second year of specialization. Yoann will be focusing on the realm of AR/VR, while I am leaning towards machine learning.

Furthermore, to produce this project, we have utilized free-to-use assets such as graphics and music. Despite the extraordinary quality of these assets, for which we extend our gratitude to <a href="https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii" target="_blank">Robert Norenberg</a> for distributing such a generous pack, they are not unique. If we were to develop a game for commercial purposes, we would undoubtedly collaborate with a graphic designers to craft a distinct and immersive ambiance.
